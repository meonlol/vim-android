These notes are here because I am good with information, but bad at
remembering what I was just thingking about, or what I've found out before.
They are just for myself, so I just need to understand them myself. I'll
probably even be mixing the odd Germain or Dutch word. You have been warned.


The plugin seems to reload all it's functionality as soon as a java file, or
the Android.xml is opened.

# PLUGIN
Everything in the plugin directory is available as soon as the plugin is
loaded. The new AndroidScan command is here.
- move android#scan() method into here?


# AndroidBuild
This only seems to work when % is a Java file.


This modline makes my notes look the way I want them to (like the help).
